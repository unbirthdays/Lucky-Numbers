Given a number, n, return an array containing n unique random numbers between 1-10, inclusive. (That is, do not repeat any numbers in the returned list.)

You can trust that this function will never be called with n < 0 or n > 10.

For example:

luckyNumbers(2)
// returns (3, 7)
luckyNumbers(6)
// returns (1, 7, 9, 6, 5, 2)
